# Building a PowerBI report for Waggle 
This project is showing the insights and the dashboard for decision making as requested.
Note: This is Udacity Project.
# Project Overview
You work as a business intelligence analyst for Waggle, a startup that makes smart devices for pets. Recently, Waggle has been thrilled by the success of their new Lapdog device, a fitness collar that lets owners track their dog’s steps, alerts them when it’s time for a walk, and even repels fleas! Reviews have been fantastic, sales are growing, and—best of all—the product really works!

This success has led Waggle’s CEO to push for a feline version but there are concerns about its viability. For this reason, the product team distributed 1,000 Lapcat prototypes for field testing. Now, after months of data collection, you have been tasked with delivering a boardroom-ready Power BI report that tells the story of how the Lapcat data compares to findings from the dog collar Lapdog devices. You’re excited because your work will be presented at the highest levels of the company and will either help convince the CEO that Lapcat is the next big thing or a costly mistake to be avoided.
# Resources and Basic Requirements
A data model has already been provided for you in the Power BI file, as well as a variety of Waggle marketing images and branding guidelines. Your report should demonstrate best practices in clean layout design and color use, utilize at least 7 different Power BI visualizations, include buttons for navigation between pages and/or bookmarks, and satisfy the business requests stated above.
# Project Steps
1-Review the included data model and business questions and identify which fields can be used to design metrics that answer the CEO’s questions. (That's all, just understand the data!) <br>
2-Develop one or more visualizations that specifically address the CEO’s questions about whether there was a difference in average daily steps over time between the two devices and how Lapcat owners rated their device compared to Lapdog owners.<br>
3-Address the product team’s request for demographic insights, using each of the following visuals at least once: Bar chart, line chart, donut chart, table/matrix, scatter plot, bubble map, and card.<br>
4-Place your data visualizations and design an appropriate layout that emphasizes the most important findings first, with the CEO's questions answered on the first page, insights about the differences between dogs and cats on the second, and insights about the families who own the pets on the third.<br>
5-In your data visualizations, incorporate the branding elements requested by the Chief Marketing Officer.<br>
6-Please include at least five slicers on each page with at least one example of a drop-down slicer, at least one example of a slider slicer, at least one example of a hierarchy slicer, at least one example of a slicer with “Select All” enabled, and one example of a slicer with the search box enabled.<br>
7-Create at least two bookmark features. One must allow users to dynamically swap one visual out with a different one and another must reset all applied filters on the page.<br>
8-Create buttons that help your users navigate your report. Buttons must respond when users hover over them by changing color or size (or both!).<br>

This is the company colors guidlines so we have to create our custom theme accordinglingy. And save it in the same folder that contains all the dataset and pbix file. <br>

# Always remember to use acceptable colors in your customized theme!! <br>

# Answer the CEO's questions!
To address the CEO’s first question, create one or two visualizations that highlight the difference (if any) between average daily steps over time recorded on Lapdog devices vs. Lapcat devices. <br>
Your visual must display the trend over time by year and month. Take a lokk at the data and then decide what to do according to the CEO's question. <br>
Once all data visuals have been created, start to design your layout. Your layout should include the following:
# Layout & Report Design
A header/banner on each page that includes the title of the report page and the Waggle logo <br>
An area either on the left-hand side of your report or below the banner for slicers that can be used to filter the report<br>
An area either on the left-hand side of your report or below the banner for buttons that can be used to navigate the report<br>
Only Waggle-approved palette colors and black, white, shades of gray<br>

# Interactivity & Filtering
On each page of your report, please include at least five slicers derived from the provided datasets demonstrating at least one of each of the following slicer visualization options:
